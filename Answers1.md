# Sections 00 (Intro) to 05 (Vecs)

## Section 00
### Intro1
- This code did compile as it was not meant to have anything wrong
- I did add another print line though just for fun
### Intro2
- This code did not compile because the name of the print line function was incorrect
    - The name they used was `printline!("Hello world!")`
- I fixed this by using the proper function name for print line
    - The correct name is `println!()`
